      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente.
        Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the pasta is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
        Add the shrimp, season with salt and black pepper, and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side until pink
        and opaque. Remove shrimp from the skillet and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same skillet, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the minced garlic and saut√© for
        about 1 minute until fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to medium-low. Pour in the heavy cream and let it simmer for a few minutes until it thickens slightly.
        Stir in the grated Parmesan and Pecorino Romano cheeses, stirring continuously until the cheese has melted and the
        sauce is smooth. Add the nutmeg, if using, and season with salt and black pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cooked pasta and shrimp back into the skillet. Toss everything together until well coated in the sauce.
